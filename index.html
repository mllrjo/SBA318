<!--
This game will involve identifying numerals that emerge with a specified RGB profile
from a specified RGB background, along the vector connecting these two RGB settings.

The rate of emergence will be set dynamically so as to modulate how challenging it is,
and the time it takes the player to recognize the image - and if recognized
correctly - will be recorded.

To start, we set up the numeral selection pad.
We set up a pad to enter source and target RGB levels, and transition time.
That's two (R,G,B) values, where 0 <= R, G, B <= 255.
Really ought to be projected onto a sphere with radius brightness, but never mind.
Times will be measured in milliseconds.
Click on "start" button to start each round.
